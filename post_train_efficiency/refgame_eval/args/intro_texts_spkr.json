This task consists of multiple rounds in which you interact with the listener on the same referential context (represented by 4 word cards). In each round, I give you one of the 4 words as the target. You should refer to the target with a referring expression describing the target, without mentioning the target word itself or any words in the referential contexts. If any of the context words is a compound word, you cannot mention their components or any part of the word either.

You can use whatever description you think will be helpful to the listener. Make sure your expression can distinguish the target from other items.
